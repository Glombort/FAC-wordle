Wordle feature takehome challenge

Based on the viral word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

## User Stories focused on 
:white_check_mark: Input from user checked against word with coloured feedback

:white_check_mark: Allow for multiple attempts on the same page

I chose these user stories as I felt they were an interesting thought to how to accomplish it, whilst also being the user story to achieve a game that is fully playable.

## Stretch Goals
:white_large_square: Sequential transition of users answer being correct or not

:white_large_square: If multiple of the same letter inputted but only one in solution, only one is coloured
